            Hello there, internet user! It's likely that you stumbled across this site while surfing the web absent-mindedly one day,
            either that or you received a link to it.
          </center>
        </p>
        <p>
          <center>
            As you may be able to tell, this site is incredibly rudimentary. There aren't any games, videos, forums, or anything
          else that makes it stand out amoongst any other web page. That's not me trying to gain sympathy, it's just the truth.

          The reasoning behind this lack of general content can mainly be chalked up to me just not being super knowledgable on the
          intricacies of web development. I have only a loose grasp on HTML and CSS and an even looser grasp on JavaScript, if at all.

          Maybe as time goes on and I learn more about web development and design, this site will also grow and have more cool and
          fun features that people will want to stick around for.
        </center>

          In the meantime, however, I'm glad you came around. Have an amazing day!
